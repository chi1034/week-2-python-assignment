Week 2 Python Assignment

This assignment demonstrates basic list operations in Python.

Tasks Performed:

Created an empty list.
Appended the values: 10, 20, 30, 40.
Inserted the value 15 at the second position (index 1).
Extended the list with another list [50, 60, 70].
Removed the last element from the list.
Sorted the list in ascending order.
Found and printed the index of the value 30.
Final Output:

Index of 30: 3
Final list after all operations: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
This shows understanding of list methods like .append(), .insert(), .extend(), .pop(), .sort() and .index().
